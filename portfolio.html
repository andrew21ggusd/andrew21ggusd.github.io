        <p>The premise of the game is to shoot monsters and protect your precious crystal.<br>
        The scoring system is based on how many mobs or monsters you kill, and the randomness<br>
        occurs when the mobs spawn. As time goes down or when a feature is enabled, the mobs<br>
        can spawn more frequently and move faster. The game ends when your HP runs out, or time is up.<br>
        In certain cases, victoy can be obtained through accumulaltion of points.</p>
        <p>After all is said and done, I think that my main inspiration was last year.<br>
        This year, I successfully managed to implement two experimental features I thought of last year.<br>
        These were big hinderances in my production, but they were ultimately the most succesful points of work.<br>

        <p>These are the pictures for the algorithm, use of the algorithm, and more blocks creation. This code<br>
        is an algorithm because it dictates how to calculate the visable score after adding to the variable "score".<br>
