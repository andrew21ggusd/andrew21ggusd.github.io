        <p>The premise of the game is to shoot monsters and protect your precious crystal.<br>
        The scoring system is based on how many mobs or monsters you kill, and the randomness<br>
        occurs when the mobs spawn. As time goes down or when a feature is enabled, the mobs<br>
        can spawn more frequently and move faster. The game ends when your HP runs out, or time is up.<br>
        In certain cases, victoy can be obtained through accumulaltion of points.</p>
        <p>After all is said and done, I think that my main inspiration was a game my friend made last year.<br>
        This year, I successfully managed to implement two experimental features I thought would be cool last year.<br>
        These were big hinderances in my production, but they were ultimately the most succesful points of work with minor chokes here and there.<br>

        <p>These are the pictures for the algorithm, use of the algorithm, and more blocks creation. This code<br>
        is an algorithm because it dictates how to calculate the visable score after adding to the variable "score".<br>

            a) During our coding process, we essentially drafted up the storyline above. First, we defined functions to fill out later.<br>
            Then, it turns out that during the trial and error part of coding we just made the text part of the story quite lengthy. It turns out that I can type out<br>
            large portions of words during times of relaxed pressure(?). This was one instance of difficulty which we turned into oppurtunity. We just cut apart my "essay" into parts to fit the functions, and it turned out to flow well too. The program itself was pretty basic as it was one function that called for all the other functions.<br>
            b) From what I understand, this is why functions are an example of procedural abstraction because you make one main function which calls different functions in a sequence based on answer choice for some. With abstraction, there is room for error to fix only one part of the code rather than all of it.
            c)I liked Twinkie Reflection because it was short, sweet, and had plenty of comedic impact.
